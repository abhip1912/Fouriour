Python Turtle module, probably the worse idea ever, but for little visulization this works.

A Fourier series is a way of representing a periodic function as a (possibly infinite) sum of sine and cosine functions. It is analogous to a Taylor series, which represents functions as possibly infinite sums of monomial terms. A sawtooth wave represented by a successively larger sum of trigonometric terms.
